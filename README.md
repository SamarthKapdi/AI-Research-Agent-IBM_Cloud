# AI-Research-Agent-IBM-Cloud
AI-powered academic research assistant using IBM Cloud and Granite LLMs.

An AI-powered assistant to automate academic research using IBM Cloud, watsonx.ai, and Granite LLMs.
It simplifies literature review, summarization, citation management, and report generation, enabling researchers to focus on critical analysis and innovation.

Problem Statement

Researchers spend significant time on repetitive tasks like:

Searching and reading multiple papers

Extracting citations and metadata

Summarizing and drafting literature reviews

The AI Research Agent addresses this by automating research tasks using NLP and LLMs on IBM Cloud.

Proposed Solution

Data Collection: Fetch papers via APIs (arXiv, IEEE, PubMed) and ethical crawling

Data Processing: Parse PDFs/HTML, extract metadata, and clean text

AI/ML Core:

Query understanding & semantic search

Paper summarization & synthesis

Hypothesis generation and draft report creation

Deployment: IBM Cloud (Code Engine + Cloud Functions) with a simple web interface

Expected Outcome:

60-70% reduction in manual literature review time

Faster, high-quality research report generation

Technologies Used

IBM watsonx.ai with Granite LLMs

IBM Cloud Functions (Serverless backend)

IBM Cloud Code Engine (Web app deployment)

IBM Cloud Object Storage (Temporary report storage)

Python (Flask / FastAPI, PyPDF2, Transformers)

HTML/CSS for dashboard UI
